## 🌟 **About the Project**

This project focuses on analyzing a **banking dataset** to identify factors influencing customer subscription to term deposits. By combining **machine learning** and **neural networks**, we predict customer decisions while showcasing the importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.

🔍 **Dataset Used:** `bank-full.csv`  
🎯 **Goal:** Predict customer subscription (`yes` or `no`) to term deposits.

## 🔑 **Key Features**

✨ **End-to-End Workflow:**
- **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis**: Gain insights with detailed visualizations.  
- **🛠 Feature Engineering**: Transform raw data into meaningful features.  
- **⚙️ Model Training**: Train models like Random Forest and Neural Networks.  
- **📈 Model Evaluation**: Compare performance using accuracy and AUC metrics.

✨ **Class Imbalance Handling:**  
- Implement techniques like oversampling and SMOTE.

✨ **Interactive Visualizations:**  
- Use `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` for storytelling.
